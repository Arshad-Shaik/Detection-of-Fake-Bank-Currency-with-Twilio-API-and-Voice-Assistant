# Detection-of-Fake-Bank-Currency-with-Twilio-API-and-Voice-Assistant

# **ðŸ§¾ 1. Project Title**

*Evaluation of Deep Learning Algorithms for the Detection of Fake Bank Currency with Twilio API and Voice Assistant*

# **ðŸ“Œ 2. Project Description**

*This project detects counterfeit banknotes using deep learning techniques CNN - **Convolutional Neural Network** and LBP - **Local Binary Pattern**, integrates a voice-based assistant for interaction, and uses OTP authentication via Twilio API to secure access. The GUI is developed using Python's Tkinter with animated transitions and visual feedback to ensure an intuitive experience.*
